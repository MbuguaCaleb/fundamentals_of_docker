What is docker?

Docker helps us to consistently build,run and ship our applications.

Helps us package our application together with everything it needs and therefore our application
is guaranteed to run effectvely in any environment.

if my app works on my dev machinne its guarantted to
work come production.

My teammate also does not have to install every single package which is cumbersome and timeconsuming.

They just run docker compose up and everthing is installed.
