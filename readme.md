**Docker**

```
It is a container technology.A tool that is used to create  and manage Containers.


What are containers??

It is a standardized unit of sofware.
It is a package of code and all the dependencies used to run that code.

The same container always yields the same application and execution behaviour no
matter where it is executed.

Support for containers is built in modern operating sytems.

Docker simplifies the creation and management of such containers.


I.e

If i am developing a node js application,i install all module and packages
required to run that code in a container.

Advantage

1.The same container always yields the same application and execution no matter where
it is executed or by whom its executed.

2.Support for containers is build into modern operating systems.

Big Point

Docker simplifies the creation and management of such containers.

(It is possible to create containers without docker but what docker does it that
ir really simpifies that process.
)

**Why containers??**

```
(a)Different production and development environments.

Code that may work locally on our machines may no longer work well on a server .Eg node js version of the server may be outdated.

Biggest advantage of using same production and development enviroment.This is where docker containers bridge the gap.

We want to build and test in excactly the same environemnt which we built our app.

This is where docker comes in.

(b)Different development environments within a Team/Company.

Every Team member should have exactly the same environment when working on the same project.

(c)Clashing Tools/Version between two different projects.

When switching between projects,tools used in Project A at times clash with tools used in project B.A good example is when you have developed projects in two different versions of PHP.


N/B

It is diadvantageous to use virtual machines which are other machines(computers) installed into our system because of memory consumption.

In as much as they may run your different versions of code independently they are an overkill when you  use most of them and in the long run end slowing down your computer.
