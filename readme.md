**Docker**

```
It is a container technology.A tool that is used to create  and manage Containers.


What are containers??

It is a standardized unit of sofware.
It is a package of code and all the dependencies used to run that code.

The same container always yields the same application and execution behaviour no
matter where it is executed.

Support for containers is built in modern operating sytems.

Docker simplifies the creation and management of such containers.


I.e

If i am developing a node js application,i install all module and packages
required to run that code in a container.

Advantage

1.The same container always yields the same application and execution no matter where
it is executed or by whom its executed.

2.Support for containers is build into modern operating systems.

Big Point

Docker simplifies the creation and management of such containers.

(It is possible to create containers without docker but what docker does it that
ir really simpifies that process.
)
